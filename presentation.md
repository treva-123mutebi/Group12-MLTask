# Title: Exploring Gender Differences in School Enrollment

## Introduction:
We will examine how boys and girls are distributed across different grade levels and uncover any variations in enrollment. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from various schools, we aim to gain insights that promote fairness and equality in education. Let's dive into our research questions and methods used to explore the data.

## Project Overview:
Our project focuses on understanding gender differences in school enrollment. We believe it's important to address any gaps and understand why these differences exist. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to discover information that can guide educational policies and practices, striving for equal opportunities in school.

## Research Questions:
During our analysis, we aimed to answer the following questions:
1. How many boys and girls, on average, are enrolled in each grade level and school type?
2. Are there noticeable differences in enrollment between boys and girls across grade levels?
3. Are there specific grade levels where we see significant differences in gender enrollment?
4. Are there any patterns in gender enrollment across different types of schools?

## Methodology:
To answer these questions, we used a dataset that provided enrollment data for different grade levels and school types. We calculated the average enrollment for boys and girls in each grade level. By comparing these averages and visually representing the data, we aimed to identify any variations in gender enrollment.

## Results and Findings:
Through our analysis, we gained insights into gender differences in school enrollment. We discovered average enrollment counts for boys and girls in different grade levels, helping us understand where disparities may exist. By visualizing the data, we highlighted any notable differences, contributing to a better understanding of gender's impact on enrollment.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, our project on gender differences in school enrollment aimed to uncover insights that promote fairness and equality in education. By addressing our research questions and analyzing the dataset, we gained valuable information about the average enrollment of boys and girls across grade levels and school types. We hope that by sharing our findings, we can raise awareness and inspire actions towards creating inclusive and equal educational opportunities for all students.
